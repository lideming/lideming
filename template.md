  <summary><b>Programming</b></summary>

In the past, he had tried many programming languages (C, C++, Java, PHP, Python), before he learned C#/.NET and wrote some desktop apps.

He also used C#/.NET to implement some network protocols, with high performance in mind, then he learned some details about some language runtimes like .NET CLR, and knew some low-level APIs that OS provides.

In recent years, he wrote code in TypeScript mostly. He would like to write vanilla TypeScript and JavaScript, aiming for minimal overhead. He started to create a Web UI framework before learning frameworks like React.

  <summary><b>Playing with Operating Systems</b></summary>

When he was 5, he had played with the Control Panel on a PC running Windows XP for months, before he finally knew that he could play Flash games within Internet Explorer 6, with a soft-limit (half hour per day) from parents.

He installed Windows 7 on his laptop after its release. Aero effect and the functionality provided by the desktop compositor is amazing to him.

He is an Arch Linux user because its lightweight and customizability. But he would like to run Ubuntu Server on remote servers since Arch Linux is probably not for servers. He likes to tweak memory management and filesystem parameters for best efficiency.

He is also a Windows user as he used to be. He run Windows on bare-metal, which could also be launched from Linux in a VM (libvirt/QEMU/KVM).

He said Btrfs is the best filesystem in the world. Its Copy-on-Write design has many cool features and advantages.

  <summary><b>Natural Language</b></summary>

His native spoken language is Mandarin Chinese.

He learned a little English in school but more from the Internet.

He enjoyed watching anime, so he can understand a little Japanese. There are so many kanji and "Japanglish" katakana words in Japanese, which make Japanese easier for him.
