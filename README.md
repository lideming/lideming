## Programming

In the past, he had tried many programming languages, before he learned C#/.NET and wrote some desktop apps.

He also used C#/.NET to implement some network protocols, then he understood some details about some language runtimes like .NET CLR, and knew some low-level APIs that OS provides.

But in the recent two years, he wrote code in TypeScript more than other programming languages. He would like to write vanilla TypeScript and JavaScript, aiming for minimal overhead. He started to create a Web UI framework before learning frameworks like React.

## Operating Systems and Filesystems

When he was 5, he had played with the Control Panel on a PC running Windows XP for months, before he finally knew that he could play Flash games within Internet Explorer 6, with a soft-limit (half hour per day) from parents.

He installed Windows 7 on his laptop after its release. Aero effect and the functionality provided by the desktop compositor is amazing to him.

He is an Arch Linux user because its high customizability. But he would like to run Ubuntu Server on remote servers since Arch Linux doesn't seem to be suitable for servers. He usually tweaks memory management and filesystem parameters of the Linux kernel for best efficiency.

He is also a Windows user as he used to be. He run Windows on bare-metal or run the same Windows instance on libvirt/QEMU/KVM.

He said Btrfs is the best filesystem in the world. Its Copy-on-Write design brings many features and advantages. For example, it has checksum for integrity of metadata and data, it provides data compression, it can merge multiple small changes into a continuous writing.


## Natural Language

His native spoken language is Mandarin Chinese.

He learned a little English in school but learned more English from the Internet.

He enjoyed watching anime, so he can understand a little Japanese. There are so many kanji and English katakana words in Japanese, which make Japanese easier for him.
